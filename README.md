# AI Automation for Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector using AI automation and machine learning techniques in R. It demonstrates the entire process from data preprocessing to model evaluation, specifically designed to analyze customer data, identify significant patterns, and predict the likelihood of customers discontinuing their service.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Develop a machine learning model with high accuracy for predicting customer churn.
- **Insightful Data Analysis**: Employ exploratory data analysis to uncover underlying patterns and trends in customer behavior.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Provide a data-driven approach for banks to proactively address customer retention.
- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tune the machine learning model for optimal performance.
- **Automation and Scalability**: Create an automated system that can scale and handle large volumes of data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Integrate the model into a user-friendly interface for accessibility (future scope).

## How It Works
This project leverages R programming and machine learning to predict customer churn. Here's the workflow:
1. **Data Collection & Simulation**: Generate a simulated dataset representing banking customer data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform the raw data for analysis.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Develop new features for deeper insights.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use `ggplot2` and `reshape2` for visual data exploration.
5. **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Apply SMOTE to balance the dataset.
6. **Model Training**: Train the model using the XGBoost algorithm.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate performance using ROC curves.
8. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model's parameters.
9. **Deployment**: Implement the model for real-time churn prediction.

## Features
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Utilizes `ggplot2` and `reshape2` for comprehensive data visualization and exploration.
- **Machine Learning Modeling**: Implements XGBoost for predicting customer churn.
- **Data Preprocessing and Balancing**: Applies feature engineering techniques and SMOTE.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses ROC curves for model assessment.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Demonstrates tuning of XGBoost model parameters.

## Installation
```R
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("caret")

## Usage
The primary script for this project is `churn_prediction.R`. Execute this script in your R environment to perform the analysis and modeling. It covers data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training and evaluation, and saving the model for future use.

## Dataset
The project uses a simulated dataset of banking customers, which includes features like age, gender, account balance, product usage, and churn status. This dataset is created within the script for demonstration purposes.
